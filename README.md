Project Overview

    The Fashion Recommendation System is a machine learning project aimed at providing personalized fashion recommendations to users based on their preferences and purchase history. 
    The system uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation approaches to suggest clothing items, accessories, and other fashion products.

Features

	•	Personalized Recommendations: Suggests fashion items tailored to individual user preferences.
	•	Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.
	•	Content-Based Filtering: Provides recommendations by analyzing the attributes of items the user has liked.
	•	Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
	•	Real-time Updates: Continuously improves recommendations based on new user data and interactions.

Data Sources

    The project utilizes the following datasets:

	•	User Interaction Data: Includes user purchase history, item ratings, and browsing behavior.
	•	Product Data: Contains product descriptions, categories, images, and attributes.
	•	Fashion Metadata: Additional metadata such as brand, price, and seasonal trends.

    Note: The datasets used may be fictional or derived from publicly available sources to ensure privacy.

Model Architecture

    The system is built using a combination of machine learning models:

	•	Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes matrix factorization techniques like Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
	•	Content-Based Filtering: Implements algorithms such as numpy, tensorflow, keras, resnet50, globalmaxpool, os to recommend items based on product attributes.
	•	Hybrid Model: Integrates the results of both collaborative and content-based approaches to generate more accurate recommendations.

Installation

    To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

	1.	Clone the Repository:
                git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-recommendation-system.git
    2.	Install Dependencies:
                 Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
                 cd fashion-recommendation-system
                 pip install -r requirements.txt
    3.	Download and Prepare Data:
                 Follow the instructions in the data/ directory to download and prepare the datasets.
	4.	Run the Application:
                 python app.py

Usage

    Once the system is up and running, you can:

	1.	Input User Data: Provide user data (e.g., past purchases, ratings) to receive recommendations.
	2.	Explore Recommendations: View the list of recommended fashion items, with options to filter by category, brand, or price.
	3.	Update Preferences: Modify user preferences or simulate new interactions to see how recommendations evolve.
